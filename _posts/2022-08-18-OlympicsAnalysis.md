This article will focus on the methods used to answer certain questions about one winter olympic games dataset.
Each question will be answered using the Python and Apache Spark library, Pyspark, which offers its own syntax for querying,
as well as the ability to query using SQL syntax. I have written each example using both Pyspark and SQL syntax, so that one might
see how the two syntaxes vary.
