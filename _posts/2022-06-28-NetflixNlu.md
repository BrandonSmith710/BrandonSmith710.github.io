Hello, welcome to this customer churn analysis report. If you'll be following allowing with the code, the csv file needed can be found on Kaggle.com or at https://github.com/BrandonSmith710/customerChurnAnalysis. Click on the filename reading, "churn.csv" and then click download. Then,
you'll just need to make sure the necessary requirements are installed in your environment(category_encoders==2.*, pdpbox==0.2.1, imgaug==0.2.5).

In this report, we will analyze independent variables of the dataset for a couple of purposes. We will see the distributions of both dependent and independent variables, preprocess the data for machine learning, train a number of ML/AI models on the data, investigate independent variables and their continuum of impact on ML model performance scores, optimize a random forest classifier model with a hyperparameter gridsearch, and finally report each model's performance.
