With an earnest desire to learn about and understand the world through technology,
I am excited on a daily basis by opportunities to form hypotheses concerning real world events, investigate data, sculpt predictions, and learn from findings. When in a comfortable environment with other engaged data scientists, I find that there is no challenge which cannot be overcome by connecting, collaborating, creating and learning. Currently my goals are to build more projects and applications which implement the services I offer. I believe everyday is an opportunity to be the best, and that facing new challenges allows me to evolve.

Here's a bit more about me:

- I am 24 years old
- I have been learning about Python for two years
- I studied data science at Bloom Institute of Technology
- My favorite sectors of data science are natural language processing and database development
- I plan to continue my personal research of cyber security as it may pertain to data science or analytics tasks
- As technology takes new forms, I accept the facts without hesitation and embrace challenge within change
