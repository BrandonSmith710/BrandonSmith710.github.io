With an earnest desire to understand the cohesion of technology and business,
I am excited on a daily basis by opportunities to make engineering discoveries, create analytical solutions, and advance my intuition with data. When in a productive environment with engaged data engineers and scientists, I find that there is no challenge which cannot be overcome by collaboration, attention and time. I believe every day offers a chance to gain experience, and that facing new challenges allows me to grow.

Here's a bit more about me:

- I am 25 years old
- I have been learning about Python for three years
- I studied data science, machine learning and data warehousing at Bloom Institute of Technology
- My favorite sectors of data science are natural language and pipeline development
- As technology evolves, I enjoy overcoming new obstacles and learning new techniques
